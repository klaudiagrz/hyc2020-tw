# Markdown basics

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text syntax.
This document presents some basic Markdown syntax. 
If you're new to Markdown, or need to refresh your memory, this is a good place to start.

## Basic formatting

Markdown lets you add some basic formatting to your text. For example, you can format text as **bold** or *italicized*. 

- To format text as **bold**, add two asterisks (`**`) before and after the text:
    
  ```
  **This text is bold.**
  ```

- To use *italics*, add one asterisk (`*`) before and after the text:

  ```
  This text is italicized.
  ```
  
## Headings

To better structure your documents and improve readability, Markdown lets you use headings.
For example, the title of this document uses Heading 1 (H1), and the titles of the sections use Heading 2 (H2). There are six heading levels (H1-H6), with H1 being the biggest and H6 the smallest.
To add a heading, precede it with corresponding number of hashes (`#`) and one space.

- To format text as H1, use one hash (`#`) followed by a space before the text:

  ```
  # This is H1.
  ```
  
- To format text as H5, use five hashes (`#####`) followed by a space before the text:

  ```
  ##### This is H5.
  ```
  
> **NOTE:** Do not forget the space character after the hash(es)! Otherwise, the formatting won't work, and your text will be displayed as regular text preceded by a hash.

## Links

Markdown lets you easily add hyperlinks to text.

- To add a hyperlink to a piece of regular text, enclose the linked text in the square brackets (`[]`), and follow it immediately with the target URL enclosed in parentheses (`()`):

  ```
  [This text links to Google](https://google.com)
  ```
  
  > **TIP:** If you don't want to provide alternative text to your link, just provide the URL without any additional formatting: `https://google.com`. This link will be highlighted and clickable.
